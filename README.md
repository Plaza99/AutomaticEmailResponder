In a world where managing high volumes of emails is a time-consuming task, the Automatic Email Responder comes to your aid. By automating the process of generating responses based on email context, this tool aims to enhance communication quality while saving valuable time for users.
The Automatic Email Responder is a Python-based tool designed to automate email responses based on incoming email context. It aims to streamline communication and save time for users by generating high-quality responses swiftly.
The application consists of two main blocks:
- Email Retrieval/Creation: Uses Google Gmailâ€™s API to retrieve and read incoming emails and prepare draft responses.
- Reply Generation: Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate contextually relevant responses.
